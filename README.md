# Project Overview:

I developed a personal finance application where users can input and track their expenses. I used AWS Amplify to simplify the development process by integrating authentication (AWS Cognitio), user authorization (AWS IAM), database (Dynamo DB) & GraphQL API, and hosting for CI/CD via GitHub. Project deployed at: https://main.d3oritrzpio0z8.amplifyapp.com/ 

Tech Stack:

- Backend - DynamoDB, GraphQL
- Frontend - React.js

# Get Started:

1) Create an account via email
2) Create expenses - you can create, read, update, delete, sort & filter
3) Get the category breakdown to see your spending habits over a time period

# Outcomes

I took on this project to familiarize myself with cloud deployment patterns and AWS services that are evermore present in modern software development. I documented the entire process, beginning on 12/18/23 and finishing on 12/31/23. I took 4 days off for the holidays and estimate I spent about 30 hours total - a big chunk of time, maybe 1/3 of the time, on the project setup and configuration via Amplify. I learned so much about Amplify and connecting to the various AWS services that I can proudly say I achieved my goal just by completing this project. In addition to learning AWS, I learned React and feel as though I have an very solid foundation of the language. Usually, I learn languages after being introduced to them in school, but I have only ever seen React on my personal time. I picked it up very quickly and I am now incredibly adept at sifting through documentation for the information I actually need. Overall, the skills I learned in this seemingly simple project are not only in-demand by the industry, but are vital to any programmer's success.
