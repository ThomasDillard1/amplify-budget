# Project Overview:

I developed a personal finance application where users can input and track their expenses. I used AWS Amplify to simplify the development process by integrating authentication (AWS Cognitio), user authorization (AWS IAM), database (Dynamo DB) & GraphQL API, and hosting for CI/CD via GitHub. Project deployed at: https://main.d3oritrzpio0z8.amplifyapp.com/ 

Tech Stack:

- Backend - DynamoDB, GraphQL
- Frontend - React.js

# Get Started:

1) Create an account via email
2) Create expenses - you can create, read, update, delete, sort & filter
3) Get the category breakdown to see your spending habits over a time period
